# Post 1 - a beginning

Ahh, the inaugural blog post. Like a New Years' Resolution, it's a wholehearted commitment likely, if not inevitably, to be derailed by harsh reality. Until then, I hope to document some cool projects, share some thoughts, and strengthen the technical and compositional muscles required for a blog.

I've always loved writing. Once I got into development, writing documentation for projects quickly became a source of great satisfaction. The humble "readme.md" file that a new project often starts with, and is frequently neglected, became a personal challenge to fit the essence of the project into a concise and friendly format. This blog is kind of an attempt to be able to just do *more of that*, but about anything I find interesting, and in a more casual format.

## The tech

Most of my professional experience has been at varying levels of the 'back-end' tech stack. I'm most comfortable when working with servers, containers, back-end languages, and APIs - preferably from a shell. So, I decided to build this blog using tech that I'm decidedly *un*-comfortable with, while keeping it simple enough that I can mostly focus on writing and publishing. A jamstack site deployed to Netlify seemed to fit the bill (and tick the requisite buzzword boxes). I liked the looks of 11ty's documentation and community, and the [eleventy-high-performance-blog](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/eleventy-high-performance-blog/) project seemed to provide a great starting point that would work essentially 'out-of-the-box' and also be easily extensible and customizable.

I'm aiming to be able to write my posts straight in Markdown (I use [Writemonkey 3](https://writemonkey.com/wm3/), which is a beautiful distraction-free editor with full Markdown support), then deploy to Netlify on commit. I haven't actually deployed anything at the time of writing, but if you're reading this then it means it's working! (To some degree...)
