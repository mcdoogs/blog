Our yard attracts a great variety of birds in every season. A small brook and stand of trees out back makes our property something of an oasis for wildlife in an otherwise densely populated suburban neighborhood. We encourage our feathered visitors with one suet feeder, a traditional feeder for seed and nuts, and the occasional fruit or berries.

## The problem: suet in summer

According to the [Audubon Society](https://www.audubon.org/news/11-tips-feeding-backyard-birds), suet shouldn't be put out during hot weather. As we were in for the first heat wave of the year, I brought in the suet feeder and decided to try my hand at their suggested alternative; peanut butter. I liked the idea of stuffing it into the crevices of a pinecone - that sounded easy to do, and would blend in nicely with its environment.

Unfortunately, there aren't any pine trees nearby; however, a few fallen trees out back were good candidates for sourcing a hanging log feeder from. I cut a section out that approximately matched the size of the metal feeder that it would hang next to.

The book [The Audubon Society Guide to Attracting Birds](https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9780801488641/the-audubon-society-guide-to-attracting-birds/#bookTabs=1) suggests holes of one-inch diameter be drilled into the log, and even provides a helpful illustration:

My 'miscellaneous hardware' drawer had exactly one screw hook, thankfully (note to self: pick up more at the hardware store next trip!). 'Making' the feeder was as simple as screwing that into the top of the log, then going to town drilling holes with a one-inch spade bit at random locations on the log. Each hole was one or two inches deep. I started drilling at the bottom and then worked my way up, which led to sparser hole placement near the top as I began to crave a return to air conditioning. In retrospect this was an obvious mistake, since the lower holes don't have enough log beneath them for the birds to grab onto. This leads to the holes higher up getting cleaned out much more quickly than the ones below; just the nuthatch, who for whatever reason prefers eating upside down, has easy access to the bottom row of holes.

I followed Audubon's suggestion of mixing one part peanut butter with five parts corn meal for the food. I found it easiest to mix and fill by hand.

After a few confused fly-bys by the old suet feeder's biggest fans, birds started flocking to the new feeder. Even though it took very little effort to make, it was still gratifying to see our feathered friends' obvious approval of my handiwork.
