Hi! My name is Mike McDougal.

I'm a developer, IT enthusiast, and hobbyist electronics tinkerer. I find it highly rewarding to deeply explore  varied technologies, with a focus on understanding complex systems from the ground up. This means you're equally likely to find me soldering, coding, or ~~bringing down production~~ performing unscheduled maintenance in the server closet. 

When I'm not in front of the computer, I can be found backpacking, kayaking, climbing, or hauling my telescope to dark skies. This is my personal blog, which I'm intending to use mostly as writing and tech practice. However, I hope that if you're reading this page it's because you found something I posted to be useful!
