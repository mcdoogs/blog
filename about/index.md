Hi! My name is Mike McDougal. I'm interested in a wide variety of topics, including astronomy, web development, systems administration and engineering, 3D printing, and electronics. This is my personal blog, which I'm intending to use mostly as writing and tech practice. However, I hope that if you're reading this page it's because you found something I posted to be useful!

This blog template is based on [eleventy-high-performance-blog](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/eleventy-high-performance-blog/) which itself is based on [eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog).
